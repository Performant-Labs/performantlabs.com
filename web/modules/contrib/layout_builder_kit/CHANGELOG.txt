Layout Builder Kit 2.0.0-alpha2, 2022-12-06
------------------------------------------
Changes since 2.0.0-alpha1:
- Turns out $events['hook_event_dispatcher.theme'] is needed after all.

Layout Builder Kit 2.0.0-alpha1, 2022-12-05
------------------------------------------
Changes since 2.0.0-dev (2022-11-16):
- It looked like the ThemeHookEvents::THEME constant wasn't available (see
  https://www.drupal.org/project/layout_builder_kit/issues/3282326) however the problem was transient for me.
  Might still need to use $events['hook_event_dispatcher.theme'][] = ['themeEvent'] but we'll see.

Layout Builder Kit 2.0.0-dev, 2022-11-16
------------------------------------------
Changes since 1.0.0-beta5:
- Hook Event Dispatcher (HED) module requirement updated to ^3
- minimum core compatibility upgraded to 9.3 because HED 3.3+ requires Drupal 9.3+
- not compatible with D10 yet; seems to be a PHP8 incompatibility with a dependency
